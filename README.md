# The Everyone Store

The Everyone Store is a React.js-based e-commerce platform offering a user-friendly shopping experience with a wide range of products.


## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through getting a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
* Node.js (Recommended: the latest stable version)
* npm (Comes with Node.js)


### Installation

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/The-Everytone-Store/Frontend.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the correct directory:
    ```sh
    cd /Frontend
    ```

3. Install the frontend dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    

### Running the Application

To run the frontend of The Everyone Store:

1. Make sure you are in the correct directory:
    ```sh
    cd ../client
    ```

2. Start the React development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

   The application should now be running and accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To run the backend server:

1. Navigate to the `server` directory from the root of the project:
    ```sh
    cd everyonestore/server
    ```

2. Start the backend server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

   Ensure the backend is configured to run on a port that does not conflict with the frontend, typically [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
